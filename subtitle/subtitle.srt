00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,860
This is Chapter 1 of the flask make a tutorial welcome.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,270
Before we begin I want to spend a couple of minutes showing you how you can work.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,630
But the code repository and get hub.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,750
Why'd you do this tutorial.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,490
The address is get hub dot com slash Miguel Greenburgh slash microblog.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:31,010
And this repository is carefully structured with one commit per chapter.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,570
So if you are doing chapter one as is the case now you can click on the commit and see exactly what

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,990
changes went in to that chapter

9
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:54,420
and other useful option is to click on the browse button on the right for the commit and this will give

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,360
you a browse several repository at that chapter.

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,740
From here you can also download a zip file if you want to have the files locally on your machine.

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:17,360
The first few chapters are simple enough that I'm going to type them directly and I recommend that you

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,040
do too so that you familiarized with the project later on when the code changes become longer and a

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,800
little bit more complicated.

15
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:34,700
You may want to come to this repository to copy and paste certain sections that will be very tedious

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,240
to write.

This is Chapter 3 of the flask mega tutorial.

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,860
In this chapter we are going to look at another core component of web applications web forms in the

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,530
previous chapter we've seen how the application can present information to users.

00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,140
Now it's time to look at how the user can provide information to the application through the use of

00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,420
forms.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:33,250
Before we begin make sure that you have your microblog as your current directory that your virtual environment

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,890
is activated and that you have your flask app environment variable set.
